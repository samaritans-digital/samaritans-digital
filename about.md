title: What we do
---

We are a team of product people building better digital services for Samaritans.

We work in an agile, user-centred way. We value user needs, continuous improvement, and inclusive design.

Our goal is to equip the charity to **be there for everyone**. At the moment, we're working on:

- Better ways to recruit and train volunteers
- New ways to help people beyond phone calls, including instant messaging
- Making it easier for our national volunteer network to collaborate

This blog exists to share things we discover and emerging practice within our field, [in the spirit of openness](https://betterdigital.services/principles/).
