    <p>We are a team of product people building better digital services for Samaritans.</p>

<p>We work in an agile, user-centred way. We value user needs, continuous improvement, and inclusive design.</p>

<p>Our goal is to equip the charity to <strong>be there for everyone</strong>. At the moment, weâ€™re working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better ways to recruit and train volunteers</li>
  <li>New ways to help people beyond phone calls, including instant messaging</li>
  <li>Making it easier for our national volunteer network to collaborate</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog exists to share things we discover and emerging practice within our field, <a href="https://betterdigital.services/principles/">in the spirit of openness</a>.</p>
