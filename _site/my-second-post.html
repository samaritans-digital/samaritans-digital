    <p><a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> is a flexible, surprisingly powerful productivity tool. We think it’s a great way to visualise and plan a team’s work.</p>

<p>Trello lets you create <strong>boards</strong>. Each board can have as many <strong>lists</strong> as you like, named whatever you want. You can add <strong>cards</strong> to each list. Cards can be re-ordered, dragged between lists and can hold different kinds of info.</p>

<p>And that’s it! Trello’s core features are very simple. You can probably learn how to use it in half an hour.</p>

<h2 id="making-a-kanban-board">Making a kanban board</h2>

<p>We love Trello because it’s flexible. Lots of productivity tools mandate a particular way of working, which can be a hassle. It’s easy to customise the way you use Trello to suit a particular project or team.</p>

<p>When we use Trello, we’re normally creating <strong>kanban</strong> boards. These are a great way to visualise the work that a team has in progress.</p>

<p>On a kanban board, each card represents a small piece of work, which we’ll organise into lists like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To do</li>
  <li>Doing</li>
  <li>Done</li>
</ul>

<p>We move cards through the lists as we work on them. Sometimes, we’ll also have more specialised lists like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Needs research</li>
  <li>Ready for review</li>
  <li>Ready for agency to build</li>
  <li>Blocked</li>
</ul>

<p>The lists you need depend on your situation, and should be tailored to fit the way your team works.</p>

<h4 id="cards-should-be-small-and-self-contained">Cards should be small and self-contained</h4>

<p>Kanban boards are most useful when each card is <strong>small and self-contained</strong>, and does not rely on any other work in order to be completed (has no external dependencies).</p>

<p>Cards can then move swiftly through the lists, and don’t sit in the “doing” list for weeks. That’s better for team morale and gives you a more precise idea of what a team is actually up to at a given moment.</p>

<p><strong>A good rule of thumb is to split any card that will take more than a week to complete down into smaller cards.</strong></p>

<h4 id="cards-should-only-move-forwards">Cards should only move forwards</h4>

<p>Cards should only go from “to do” to “doing”, and from “doing” to “done”: never backwards. After all, we can’t turn back time, and we don’t want to conceal any work that’s already begun.</p>

<p>If you find that you need to drag a card back out of “doing” and into the “to do” list, it’s probably worth breaking it down into smaller pieces of work.</p>

<h2 id="useful-add-ons">Useful add-ons</h2>

<p>Trello has a large ecosystem of “power-ups” that add additional functionality. We often use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9/custom-fields">Custom fields</a></strong> to show extra data like how big a particular piece of work is relative to others</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/59c3d177178a761767b49278/card-numbers-by-reenhanced">Card numbers</a></strong> gives unique ID numbers to each card, and are great when synchronising a Trello board to a real, physical board on a wall somewhere</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d917446f517774210012/card-aging">Card aging</a></strong> makes cards that haven’t been touched in a while go translucent, drawing attention to them</li>
</ul>

<p>We also use browser add-ons to make some of our larger boards more managable:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/collapsible-trello-lists/kejemfjfgoaekplmemlkjljcfloiemho">Collapsible lists</a></strong> allows individual lists on a board to be shrunk down, minimising distractions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-shouldnt-control-how-you-work">Tools shouldn’t control how you work</h2>

<p>Teams work in different ways, and that’s okay.</p>

<p>Simple, flexible tools like Trello don’t force teams to work in a single way, and that’s why we recommend them.</p>
